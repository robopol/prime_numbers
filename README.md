# Prime Numbers Repository

This repository contains various materials and scripts related to prime numbers: from theoretical documents to sample programs for primality testing and number factorization.

## Contents

- **[Methods of finding prime numbers.pdf](Methods of finding prime numbers.pdf)**  
  A document providing a theoretical and practical overview of prime number testing methods.

- **[prime_numbers.pdf](prime_numbers.pdf)**  
  Another document containing notes on prime number theory and testing examples.

- **[number_decomposition.py](number_decomposition.py)**  
  A Python script that factors a given number into its prime factors (factorization algorithm).

- **[prime_numbers.py](prime_numbers.py)**  
  A main Python script for prime testing and other operations involving large numbers.

- **[prime-numbers-test.html](prime-numbers-test.html)**  
  An HTML application that uses Pyodide to test if a given number is prime directly in the browser (no Python installation required).

- **prime_test GUI**  
  (Folder or file) A graphical user interface (e.g., Tkinter) for prime testing.

- **[setup_prime_test.exe](setup_prime_test.exe)**  
  An executable or installer for Windows, possibly providing an easy way to install/use the prime testing application.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Documents (.pdf)**  
   - These files contain theoretical explanations, methods, and guides on prime numbers.

2. **Python Scripts (.py)**  
   - Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
   - Run them from a terminal/command prompt, for example:
     ```bash
     python prime_numbers.py
     ```

3. **HTML Application (prime-numbers-test.html)**  
   - Open this file in a modern web browser.
   - It uses Pyodide so you can run prime tests directly in the browser, no local Python installation required.

4. **GUI or .exe**  
   - If the `.exe` file is provided, you can launch it directly on Windows.
   - Alternatively, run the `prime_test GUI` (Python script) to open a graphical interface.
